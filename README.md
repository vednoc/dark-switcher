# theme switcher

A companion theme for my other themes that allows for easy changing of the color variables, custom settings, and more! Supports DeepDark themes made by Raitaro.

A simple implementation of color-scheme switcher for my userstyles. Big thank you to [RaitaroH](https://github.com/RaitaroH) for the color-schemes and the idea of how to implement custom colors within `select` UserCSS setting. :heart:

To use it, simply click on "Install directly with Stylus" button then head over to my [userstyles](https://gitlab.com/vednoc/userstyles) project to install userstyles you'd like to use.
